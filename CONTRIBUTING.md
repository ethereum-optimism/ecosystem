# Optimism Ecosystem monorepo contributing guide

## Workflow for Pull Requests

ðŸš¨ Before making any non-trivial change, please first open an issue describing the change to solicit feedback and guidance. This will increase the likelihood of the PR getting merged.

In general, the smaller the diff the easier it will be for us to review quickly.

In order to contribute, fork the repository and make pull requests against the `main` branch

Additionally, if you are writing a new feature, please ensure you add appropriate test cases.

Follow the [Development Quick Start](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem?tab=readme-ov-file#development-quick-start) to set up your local development environment.

We recommend using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format on commit messages.

Unless your PR is ready for immediate review and merging, please mark it as 'draft' (or simply do not open a PR yet).

Once ready for review, make sure to include a thorough PR description to help reviewers.

**Bonus:** Add comments to the diff under the "Files Changed" tab on the PR page to clarify any sections where you think we might have questions about the approach taken.

### Rebasing

We use the `git rebase` command to keep our commit history tidy.
Rebasing is an easy way to make sure that each PR includes a series of clean commits with descriptive commit messages
See [this tutorial](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/git_rebase.html) for a detailed explanation of `git rebase` and how you should use it to maintain a clean commit history.
