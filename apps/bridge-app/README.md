# Example Bridge App

This is an example bridge application demonstrating how to bridge ETH & ERC20 tokens to any OP stack chain. We currently deploy this on every merge to the `main` branch. You can see what it looks like [here](https://main--magnificent-licorice-5d2277.netlify.app/).

This is still a WIP as we are waiting for more libraries to support Wagmi v2

### Setup

Create an `.env` and add `VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` to it. You can find it [here](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app/project).

```
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=<your wallet connect project id>
```
