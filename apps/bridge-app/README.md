# Example Bridge App

This is an example bridge application demonstrating how to bridge ETH & ERC20 tokens to any OP stack chain. We currently deploy this on every merge to the `main` branch. You can see what it looks like [here](https://main--magnificent-licorice-5d2277.netlify.app/)

This is still a WIP as we are waiting for more libraries to support Wagmi v2
